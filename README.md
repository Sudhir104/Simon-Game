🎮 Simon Game

This is a browser-based implementation of the classic Simon Game, developed using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
The game starts when the user presses any key. At each level, the game highlights a random color, and the player must repeat the full sequence by clicking the colored buttons in the correct order. With every successful level, the sequence grows longer, making the game more challenging. A wrong click ends the game and displays the final score.
